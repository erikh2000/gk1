# What is this repo?

Yeah, it's just got the README. Confusing, eh?

For the moment, this repo's only purpose is to enable issue tracking that we can use for reporting bugs on *The Godkiller - Chapter 1* video game.

# Has The Godkiller been open-sourced?

No, not yet. The MIT license for this repository doesn't apply to media / source you may find elsewhere.

# Will The Godkiller be open-sourced?

That's the plan! But it hasn't happened yet.

# Should I use the "Issues" feature of Github to report bugs I see in The Godkiller?

Yes, that seems like a good idea to me at the moment. We can see how it goes. I figure if you've wandered over to Github, you probably know something about bug reporting and keeping things well organized. Do phrases like "steps to reproduce" or "closed as duplicate" make sense to you, already? If so, then I would appreciate bugs reported through Github issues.

If you don't have experience reporting bugs or just want a less formal way to do it, you're welcome to post bugs on our Discord server here - https://discord.gg/vHz2m3UYnT .

# Who are you?

Erik Hermansen, the person who made the game.

# Who am I?

I have no idea! Sorry.
